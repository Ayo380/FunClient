# FunClient

FunClient is an Android app designed to interface with the FunCenter app's service for picture retrieval and audio playback. 
The app includes an activity that exposes View elements for requesting pictures by number, playing a given audio clip by number, pausing, resuming, and stopping playback. 
The app utilizes ServiceConnection and service binding techniques to enable communication with the FunCenter service, allowing for continuous audio playback even when the client activity is stopped or destroyed. 
The FunClient app is designed to meet all project requirements, including proper handling of app initialization, stopping, and destruction.
